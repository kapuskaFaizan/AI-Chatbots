# Chatbots

A chatbot is an artificial intelligence (AI) software that can simulate a conversation (or a chat) with a user in natural language 
through messaging applications, websites, mobile apps or through the telephone.
Why are chatbots important? A chatbot is often described as one of the most advanced and promising expressions of interaction betw-
een humans and machines. However, from a technological point of view, a chatbot only represents the natural evolution of a Question
Answering system leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP). Formulating responses to questions in natural language is one of the
most typical Examples of Natural Language Processing applied in various enterprises’ end-use applications.

# Rule based
The first and perhaps the most simple bots are rule-based chatbots, also known as decision-tree bots. These bots are the most comm-
on, and many of us have likely interacted with one either through Live Chat features, on e-commerce sites, or via social media.
Rule-based chatbots are able to hold basic conversations based on “if/then” logic.  These chatbots do not understand context or in-
tents. Human agents map out conversations via a flowchart, anticipating what a customer might ask, and program how the chatbot sho-
uld respond.  We use logical next steps and clear call-to-action buttons to build rule-based chatbots conversations.

# Artificial intelligence based
AI chatbots are more complex programmed bots based on Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) algorithms.Unlike
rule-based chatbots, AI-powered chatbots learn as they go.  Human agents train chatbots  to decipher free form conversations based 
on “Intents” and “Entities.” “Brains” in turn rule Intents and Entities. Entities identify a subject: People, place or things. Int-
ents are a bit harder to grasp.  

# Word2vec model
The word2vec tool takes a text corpus as input and produces the word vectors as output. It first constructs a vocabulary from the 
training text data and then learns vector representation of words. The resulting word vector file can be used as features in many 
natural language processing and machine learning applications.A simple way to investigate the learned representations is to find 
the closest words for a user-specified word. The distance tool serves that purpose. For example, if you enter 'france', distance 
will display the most similar words and their distances to 'france'.Google has one such pretrained model of about 1.5 GB size which
is used in this repository.

# Data set
We have used raddit for extracting this data we being working on since it has an enormously large database.(you can use as per your
preference)
